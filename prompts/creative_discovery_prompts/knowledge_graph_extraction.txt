Analyze these conversations to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph of Blockfrost's technical domain:

1. Entity Extraction:
   - Identify all technical entities mentioned (APIs, features, components, concepts)
   - Extract named tools, technologies, and integrations
   - Identify people, roles, and organizational elements

2. Relationship Mapping:
   - Map relationships between entities (X is part of Y, A depends on B, etc.)
   - Identify hierarchical structures and dependencies
   - Map compatibility and integration relationships
   - Note causal relationships (X causes Y, changing A affects B)

3. Attribute Extraction:
   - For each entity, extract mentioned attributes and properties
   - Note status information (working, broken, deprecated, etc.)
   - Identify configuration options and parameters
   - Extract performance characteristics and limitations

4. Process Extraction:
   - Map workflows and processes mentioned
   - Identify sequential steps and dependencies
   - Note decision points and condition branches
   - Extract typical usage patterns and best practices

5. Problem-Solution Pairing:
   - Link described problems to their solutions
   - Map errors to their causes and resolutions
   - Connect use cases to implementation approaches

6. Knowledge Gaps:
   - Identify areas where relationships are unclear or contradictory
   - Note questions that remained unanswered
   - Highlight ambiguities in the technical domain model

Present this knowledge graph in a structured format that could serve as the foundation for a comprehensive technical documentation knowledge base.
