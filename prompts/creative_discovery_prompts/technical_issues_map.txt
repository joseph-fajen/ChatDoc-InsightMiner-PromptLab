Create a comprehensive technical issues map based on these conversations:

1. Identify all technical issues, bugs, or errors mentioned
2. For each issue:
   - Provide a short descriptive title
   - Classify the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Describe the symptoms and user impact
   - Note the affected components or features
   - Document any workarounds or solutions offered
   - Track how many users reported the same or similar issues

3. Group issues by category:
   - API functionality issues
   - Configuration problems
   - Documentation gaps
   - Integration challenges
   - Performance concerns
   - Security questions

4. Prioritize issues based on:
   - Frequency of mentions
   - User impact severity
   - Whether solutions exist
   - Business impact

5. Create a "Top 5 Technical Priorities" list that would have the greatest positive impact if addressed

Present the results as a structured technical report that could be used by engineering teams to prioritize fixes.
