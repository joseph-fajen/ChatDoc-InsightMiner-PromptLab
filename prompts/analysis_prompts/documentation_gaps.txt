Analyze these conversations to identify gaps and improvement opportunities in Blockfrost's documentation:

1. Documentation Gap Analysis:
   - Identify topics, features, or processes that users frequently ask questions about
   - Highlight areas where users express confusion despite existing documentation
   - Note any explicit mentions of missing, unclear, or outdated documentation
   - Identify terminology confusion or inconsistencies

2. Documentation Prioritization:
   - Rank documentation gaps by frequency of mentions
   - Prioritize based on impact on user experience
   - Identify the most critical missing documentation components

3. Content Recommendations:
   - For each identified gap, suggest specific content that should be created
   - Recommend documentation formats most appropriate for each topic (tutorials, reference docs, FAQs, examples)
   - Suggest improvements to existing documentation based on user feedback
   - Identify where code examples, diagrams, or step-by-step guides would be valuable

4. Documentation Structure Insights:
   - Analyze if users can find information they need
   - Assess if the documentation organization makes sense to users
   - Suggest structural improvements to make information more discoverable

5. Documentation Effectiveness Metrics:
   - How frequently users need to ask questions despite documentation
   - Areas where documentation successfully prevents support requests
   - Topics where documentation exists but users still struggle

Present these findings in a format that would be actionable for a documentation team.
