{conversations}

Conduct a comprehensive feature demand analysis based on these conversations:

1. Feature Request Identification:
   - Extract explicit feature requests from users
   - Identify implicit needs based on problems users are trying to solve
   - Note workarounds users are implementing that suggest missing features

2. Feature Prioritization Framework:
   - Quantify mentions and interest in each potential feature
   - Assess business impact and technical feasibility based on context
   - Evaluate alignment with apparent product direction
   - Consider competitive differentiation possibilities

3. User Need Classification:
   - Categorize underlying user needs behind feature requests
   - Map how different user segments express varying needs
   - Identify patterns in how needs are articulated

4. Feature Specification Outlines:
   - For top requested features, provide detailed specification outlines
   - Include potential use cases, user stories, and implementation considerations
   - Note integration points with existing functionality

5. Competitive Gap Analysis:
   - Identify mentions of competitive alternatives
   - Note features users compare against other solutions
   - Highlight unique value propositions and potential differentiation

Compile this analysis into a product planning document that could guide feature development priorities.
