Analyze the provided documentation and chat conversations to identify common technical issues and challenges that users are facing. Create a structured report that:

1. Lists the top 5-7 technical issues based on frequency and severity
2. Provides a brief description of each issue
3. Includes specific error messages or symptoms when available
4. Suggests potential solutions or workarounds for each issue
5. Recommends documentation improvements that could help prevent these issues

Focus on actionable insights that would be valuable for product managers, support teams, and documentation writers to improve the user experience.
